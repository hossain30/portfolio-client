          I'm Samsujjoha Hossain

          Work globally!
        </pre>
        <p>
          With over 2 years of hands-on experience in web development, I
          specialize in building responsive, dynamic websites that not only look
          great but are also optimized for SEO. I help businesses grow online
          with modern, responsive websites designed to meet their unique needs.
          My focus is on crafting Single Page Applications (SPA) using React.js,
          ensuring smooth, fast user interactions. From creating intuitive UI/UX
          designs to managing state with tools like Redux and React Router, I
          aim to deliver solutions that are functional, scalable, and
          maintainable. I'm passionate about collaborating on global projects
          and always strive to create solutions that support business growth and
          align with your goals.
